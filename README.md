# tcparse

A library for parsing TeraChem output files into structured MolSSI data objects.

## Contributing

If you have data you need parsed from TeraChem output files please open an issue in this repo detailing the data items you'd like parsed and include an example output file from TeraChem that contains the data you need parsed.

## TODO

- Consider the output structures I want from parsers. Should they return the string only? Or should they cast the data to a type? Why or why not? How many layers to parsers do I want?
